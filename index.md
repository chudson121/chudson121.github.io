# Who Am I

I am an Agile Leader specializing in DevOps methods for Process Automation and Release Engineering using continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Here is a brief overview at my current client. I am responsible for defining and managing the Release Engineering/Devops capabilities for the division. This includes building a devops team from the ground up, managing a large number of servers, along with the configuration/maintenance of multiple testing and production environments. I direct the team that creates the continuous integration and continuous deployment tool chain automation and we successfully deployed large number of applications into production every week for the past year. I coordinate and collaborate with the App Dev, Quality Assurance, Operations, and business units to highlight high/low risk deployments. My latest project is architecting and driving the adoption of cloud solutions with our continuous delivery systems.

# A Little History

I started my career in server operations supporting a large infrastructure including thousands of servers (mostly physical ones back then) and that quickly evolved into learning to code. This allowed us to support that large of an environment without a large army of sysadmins. I coded the process to collect large amounts of data including: WMI, event logs, disk space, anti-virus versions etc and then created executive dashboards giving a holistic view of the environment and with the ability to drill down so the responsible groups could effect changes that were needed. I then buried myself in software development, making web applications for unemployment services, financial applications surrounding the mortgage process, enrollment and quoting engines for health insurance. I started leading development teams and began organization changes to use agile practices. This allowed my teams to quickly add small and large features allowing us to meet the customer demands and keep a competitive advantage to other title search organizations.

# What I Do

I help businesses bring their products and services to market faster through process automation and organizational changes. My passion is breaking down the barriers, building and improving processes, so that the engineering, testing, operations, and business teams work better and smarter. I have successfully driven the strategies of automating processes to support continuous software deployments. I have experience with public/private clouds, scripting and automation with tools like Python and .Net, and a background in Agile methodologies. That’s why I love DevOps, it’s an opportunity to be involved in the entire delivery system from start to finish.

DevOps aids in strategic IT goals:

- multi-platform development, integration, and deployments
- faster app release for staff and customers
- a better end-user and customer experience
- recover from failures fast

# How, You Ask?

DevOps is all about effective communication and collaboration. I’ve been able to deal with production issues from the development and operations sides, effectively straddling the two worlds. I’m less interested in finding blame or playing the hero than I am with ensuring that all of the moving parts come together. Using DevOps methodologies and principles found from: Agile, LEAN, and hard experience.
I like to come into an organization and using the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) by John Boyd.

- Observe
- Orientation
- Decide (Plan)
- Act (Do)
- Measure Results - i added this one in so its now more like OODAM

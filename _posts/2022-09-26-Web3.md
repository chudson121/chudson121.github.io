# How to Use Web3 to Build a Decentralized Internet

## Introduction

The internet has come a long way since its inception in the late 20th century. What started as a way to connect people and computers has evolved into a global network that is used for everything from communication to commerce. While the internet has brought many benefits, it has also created some challenges. One of these challenges is centralization. With more and more people and businesses using the internet, the risk of centralization increases. This means that a few companies or governments could end up controlling the flow of information or access to certain resources. This could have negative consequences for users, including loss of privacy, censorship, and more.
Fortunately, there is a solution: decentralized internet, or web3. Web3 is a new way of building the internet that focuses on decentralization. This means that instead of having a few centralized entities in control, power is distributed among many different users. This can help to prevent problems like censorship and data breaches.

## What is Web3

***What is the Difference Between Web2 and Web3***
Web2 is based on centralized applications and services while Web3 is based on decentralized applications and services. The main difference between the two is that with Web3, there is no central authority controlling or regulating the network. This means that anyone can develop and deploy applications on the network without needing permission from a central authority.
The benefits of using Web3 include increased security, privacy, and censorship resistance. With no central authority in control, it becomes much harder for bad actors to take down the network or censor certain applications or users. Additionally, since data is stored on a decentralized network of computers rather than centrally on servers, it becomes much harder for hackers to steal or tamper with user data.

***What is a Decentralized Internet***
A decentralized internet is one that isn’t reliant on any central servers or authorities. It’s a network that’s distributed across many different computers, devices, and locations.
There are many benefits to using a decentralized internet. For one, it’s much more resilient to attacks and outages. If one server goes down, the others can pick up the slack. Additionally, it’s more secure, since there’s no central point of failure for hackers to target. And finally, it gives users more control over their data and privacy.

So how do you build a decentralized internet? That’s where Web3 comes in. Web3 is a set of protocols and technologies that enable a decentralized web. By using Web3, you can create applications that run on a decentralized network instead of centrally-hosted servers.

There are two key components to building with Web3: Ethereum and IPFS. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: programs that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed fashion. Together, these two technologies form the foundation of the decentralized web.

Building with Ethereum generally requires learning a new programming language, Solidity. However, there are now several tools available that make it possible to build Ethereum applications without learning Solidity from scratch. These include Embark, Truffle Suite, and BlockstackJS. Once you have your development environment set up, you can start building your decentralized application (or “DApp”). The first step is to create your smart contract; this will define the rules and logic of your DApp. Next, you’ll need to write some code to interact with your smart contract (known as an “interface”). Finally, you can deploy your DApp on the Ethereum network so that it’s accessible to anyone in the world.

IPFS can be used in conjunction with Ethereum or as a standalone protocol. To use IPFS with Ethereum, you simply need to configure your DApp to store data on IPFS instead of traditional centralized servers.

## Conclusion

The decentralized internet is the future of the web. It is more secure, private, and resilient than the centralized internet we use today. Web3 is the technology that enables us to build this decentralized internet. In this blog post, we've discussed what Web3 is and how it can be used to build a decentralized internet. We hope you found this information useful and that it gives you a better understanding of the potential of the decentralized web.

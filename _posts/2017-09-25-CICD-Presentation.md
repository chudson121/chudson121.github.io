#DevOps and ALM

[Powerpoint Presentation]({{site.url}}/Files/cicdToolChain.pptx)

Do you:  
- Have your code compiling in a clean environment 
- Run all of your unit tests before deploying to a testing environment 
- all the while having your feet kicked up on the desk sipping your coffee

If not, come join us in a thought-provoking talk about Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). We will demonstrate ways of orchestrating continuous integration and continuous deployment toolchains (CI/CD). See how this toolchain allows development teams to shorten their lead times (Time to market) by quickly and efficiently delivering new features and enhancements into the hands of your customers.

More frequent releases? What?!? Why is that a good thing? 
- smaller changes (easier to identify when things go boom!) 
- improved velocity to get things to the customer (revenue!!!) 
- reduces code conflicts reduced errors and stress 
- no down time = more revenue

I have worked for fortune 500 companies, startups, and mid-sized corporations. I bring experience, passion, and know-how to the table. I help businesses bring their products and services to market faster through process automation and organizational changes such as implementing CI/CD pipelines and architectural updates to automate deployments for faster and more thorough releases. My passion for breaking down the barriers, building and improving processes, so that the engineering, testing, operations, and business teams work better and smarter is only second to my diligence to adhere to best practices, transparency between all levels of business and cross-departmental understanding.

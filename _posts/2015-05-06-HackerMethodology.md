## Hacker Methodology
	1. Scan
	2. Enumerate
	3. Penetration
	4. Escalation
	5. Pillage

## [STDD - secure test driven development](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_TDD_Project)
- Tests can be written to verify the threat.
- A solution can be implemented to block the threat, and quickly be confirmed to be working.
- Provided all other tests still pass, you can quickly verify that all other security measures and all other functionality still behave correctly.


# Benefits:
- quick turnaround time from when a threat is discovered to when a solution becomes available
- Reproduce security findings
- Debu security exploits
- Confirm code is non exploitable
- Normal testing cycles
- Not introduced at a later stage

# [My thoughts on Kubernetes and the enterprise](https://dzone.com/storage/assets/14178024-kubernetesandtheenterprise-trendreport-2020.pdf)

## Levels of abstraction

- Bare Metal
- VM
- VM Hypervisor
- Kubernetes: Resource Isolation, , implement distributed design patterns
- Kubernetes Clusters 
- Application Containers

| High availability              | 1872 |
| Horizontal elasticity          | 1863 |
| Magical, effortless deployment | 1773 |
| Memory isolation               | 1736 |
| Network stack isolation        | 1651 |
| Filesystem isolation           | 1631 |
| Granular resource control      | 1561 |

## Table 6: What Kubernetes Improves

| Things improved           | % of respondents | n   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Deployment in general     | 66%              | 313 |
| Autoscaling               | 65%              | 308 |
| CI/CD                     | 63.7%            | 302 |
| Building microservices    | 53.6%            | 254 |
| Reliability               | 46%              | 217 |
| Application modularity    | 44.3%            | 210 |
| Architectural refactoring | 36.1%            | 171 |
| Overall system design     | 33.5%            | 159 |
| Cost                      | 28.9%            | 137 |
| Security                  | 24.9%            | 118 |
| Other                     | 3.2%             | 15  |

Kubernetes has improved some aspect of software architecture
or design: building microservices (53.6%), application modularity (44.3%), architectural refactoring (36.1%), or overall system
design (33.5%).

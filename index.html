<h1>Who Am I</h1>
<p>	I am an Agile Leader specializing in DevOps methods for Process Automation and Release Engineering using continous integration and contionous delivery ( CI/CD). Here is a brief overview at my current client. I am responsible for defining and managing the Release Engineering/Devops capabilities for the division. 
This includes building a devops team from the ground up, managing a large number of servers, along with the configuration/maintenance of multiple testing and production environments. I direct the team that creates the continuous integration and continuous deployment tool chain automation and we successfully deployed large number of applications into production every week for the past year. I coordinate and collaborate with the App Dev, Quality Assurance, Operations, and business unitss to highlight high/low risk deployments. My latest project is architecting and driving the adoption of cloud solutions with our continuous delivery systems.</p>

<h1>What I Do</h1>
<p>I help businesses bring their products and services to market faster through process automation and organizational changes. My passion is breaking down the barriers, building and improving processes, so that the engineering, testing, operations and business teams work better and smarter. I have successfully driven the strategies automating processes to support continuous software deployments. I have experience with public/private clouds, tools like Chef or Puppet, scripting and automation with tools like Python and .Net, and a background in Agile. That’s why I love DevOps, it’s an opportunity to be involved in the entire delivery system from start to finish. 
</p>

<h1>How, You Ask?</h1>
<p>
DevOps is all about effective communication and collaboration. I’ve been able to deal with production issues from the development and operations sides, effectively straddling the two worlds. I’m less interested in finding blame or playing the hero than I am with ensuring that all of the moving parts come together. Using DevOps methodologies and principles found from: Agile, LEAN, and hard experience.
I focus on Microsoft's stack but also have serious dabblings in JAVA, IOS (Swift, objective-c), Python, Groovy, MongoDB, MSSQL, Oracle, Azure DocumentDB.
